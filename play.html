        <h3>Poojitha Naradasu snips a play</h3>
        <p>
            SIR HARRY. [_Complacently._] Did that seem all right, eh?

LADY SIMS. [_Much relieved._] I think perfect.<br>

SIR HARRY. But was it dignified?<br>

LADY SIMS. Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
sword.<br>

SIR HARRY. The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
moments--[_suiting the action to the word_]--the glide--the dip--the
kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
beautiful ceremony. [_Kindly._] Anything you can suggest?<br>

LADY SIMS. No--oh, no. [_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
of a cushion._] You don't think you have practised till you know what to
do almost too well?<br>

     [_He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
     would try any man._<br>

SIR HARRY. I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
asked for.<br>

LADY SIMS. [_Abashed._] I'm sorry, Harry. [_A perfect butler appears and
presents a card._] "The Flora Typewriting Agency."<br>

SIR HARRY. Ah, yes. I telephoned them to send some one. A woman, I
suppose, Tombes?<br>

TOMBES. Yes, Sir Harry.<br>

SIR HARRY. Show her in here. [_He has very lately become a stickler for
etiquette._] And, Tombes, strictly speaking, you know, I am not Sir
Harry till Thursday.<br>

TOMBES. Beg pardon, sir, but it is such a satisfaction to us.<br>

SIR HARRY. [_Good-naturedly._] Ah, they like it down-stairs, do they?<br>

TOMBES. [_Unbending._] Especially the females, Sir Harry.<br>

SIR HARRY. Exactly. You can show her in, Tombes. [_The butler departs on
his mighty task._] You can tell the woman what she is wanted for, Emmy,
while I change. [_He is too modest to boast about himself, and prefers
to keep a wife in the house for that purpose._] You can tell her the
sort of things about me that will come better from you. [_Smiling
happily._] You heard what Tombes said: "Especially the females." And he
is right. Success! The women like it even better than the men. And
rightly. For they share. _You_ share, _Lady_ Sims. Not a woman will see
that gown without being sick with envy of it. I know them. Have all our
lady friends in to see it. It will make them ill for a week.

     [_These sentiments carry him off light-heartedly, and presently the
     disturbing element is shown in. She is a mere typist, dressed in
     uncommonly good taste, but at contemptibly small expense, and she
     is carrying her typewriter in a friendly way rather than as a badge
     of slavery, as of course it is. Her eye is clear; and in odd
     contrast to_ LADY SIMS, _she is self-reliant and serene_.<br>

KATE. [_Respectfully, but she should have waited to be spoken to._] Good
morning, madam.<br>

LADY SIMS. [_In her nervous way, and scarcely noticing that the typist
is a little too ready with her tongue._] Good morning. [_As a first
impression she rather likes the woman, and the woman, though it is
scarcely worth mentioning, rather likes her._ LADY SIMS _has a maid for
buttoning and unbuttoning her, and probably another for waiting on the
maid, and she gazes with a little envy perhaps at a woman who does
things for herself_.] Is that the typewriting machine?<br>

KATE. [_Who is getting it ready for use._] Yes. [_Not "Yes, madam" as it
ought to be._] I suppose if I am to work here I may take this off. I get
on better without it. [_She is referring to her hat._<br>
