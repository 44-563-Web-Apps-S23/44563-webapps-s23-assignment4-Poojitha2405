        <h3>Poojitha Naradasu snips a play</h3>
        <p>
<p Class="speech"><h5 class="SIR-HARRY">SIR HARRY</h5></p><p class="direction"> [_Complacently._]</p> Did that seem all right, eh?</p>
<p Class="speech"><h5 class="LADY-SIMS">LADY SIMS</h5> <p class="direction"> [_Much relieved._]</p> I think perfect.<br></p>

    <p Class="speech"><h5 class="SIR-HARRY">SIR HARRY</h5> But was it dignified?</p><br>

        <p Class="speech"><h5 class="LADY-SIMS">LADY SIMS</h5> Oh, very. And it will be still more so when you have the
sword.</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="SIR-HARRY">SIR HARRY</h5> The sword will lend it an air. There are really the five
moments--<p class="direction">[_suiting the action to the word_]</p>--the glide--the dip--the
kiss--the tap--and you back out a knight. It's short, but it's a very
beautiful ceremony.<p class="direction"> [_Kindly._] </p> you can suggest?</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="LADY-SIMS">LADY SIMS</h5> No--oh, no<p class="direction"> [_Nervously, seeing him pause to kiss the tassel
of a cushion._]</p> You don't think you have practised till you know what to
do almost too well?</p><br>

    <p class="direction"> [_He has been in a blissful temper, but such niggling criticism
     would try any man.</p><br>

     <p Class="speech"><h5 class="SIR-HARRY">SIR HARRY</h5>I do not. Don't talk nonsense. Wait till your opinion is
asked for.</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="LADY-SIMS">LADY SIMS</h5> <p class="direction">[_Abashed._]</p> I'm sorry, Harry. <p class="direction">[_A perfect butler appears and
presents a card._]</p> "The Flora Typewriting Agency."</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="SIR-HARRY">SIR HARRY</h5> Ah, yes. I telephoned them to send some one. A woman, I
suppose, Tombes?</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="TOMBES">TOMBES</h5> Yes, Sir Harry.</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="SIR-HARRY">SIR HARRY</h5> Show her in here. <p class="direction">[_He has very lately become a stickler for
etiquette._] </p>, Tombes, strictly speaking, you know, I am not Sir
Harry till Thursday.</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="TOMBES">TOMBES</h5> Beg pardon, sir, but it is such a satisfaction to us.</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="SIR-HARRY">SIR HARRY</h5><p class="direction">[_Good-naturedly._] </p>, they like it down-stairs, do they?</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="TOMBES">TOMBES</h5> <p class="direction">[_Unbending._]</p> Especially the females, Sir Harry.</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="SIR-HARRY">SIR HARRY</h5> Exactly. You can show her in, Tombes. <p class="direction">[_The butler departs on
his mighty task._]</p> You can tell the woman what she is wanted for, Emmy,
while I change.<p class="direction"> [_He is too modest to boast about himself, and prefers
to keep a wife in the house for that purpose._] </p>You can tell her the
sort of things about me that will come better from you. <p class="direction">[_Smiling
happily._]</p> You heard what Tombes said: "Especially the females." And he
is right. Success! The women like it even better than the men. And
rightly. For they share. _You_ share, _Lady_ Sims. Not a woman will see
that gown without being sick with envy of it. I know them. Have all our
lady friends in to see it. It will make them ill for a week.</p>

    <p class="direction"> [_These sentiments carry him off light-heartedly, and presently the
     disturbing element is shown in. She is a mere typist, dressed in
     uncommonly good taste, but at contemptibly small expense, and she
     is carrying her typewriter in a friendly way rather than as a badge
     of slavery, as of course it is. Her eye is clear; and in odd
     contrast to_ LADY SIMS, _she is self-reliant and serene_.</p><br>

     <p Class="speech"><h5 class="KATE">KATE</h5><p class="direction"> [_Respectfully, but she should have waited to be spoken to._]</p> Good
morning, madam.</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="LADY-SIMS">LADY SIMS</h5><p class="direction"> [_In her nervous way, and scarcely noticing that the typist
is a little too ready with her tongue._] </p> morning<p class="direction"> [_As a first
impression she rather likes the woman, and the woman, though it is
scarcely worth mentioning, rather likes her._ LADY SIMS _has a maid for
buttoning and unbuttoning her, and probably another for waiting on the
maid, and she gazes with a little envy perhaps at a woman who does
things for herself_.]</p> Is that the typewriting machine?</p><br>

<p Class="speech"><h5 class="KATE">KATE</h5> <p class="direction">[_Who is getting it ready for use._]</p> Yes. <p class="direction">[_Not "Yes, madam" as it
ought to be._]</p> I suppose if I am to work here I may take this off. I get
on better without it.</p> <p class="direction">[_She is referring to her hat._</p><br>
